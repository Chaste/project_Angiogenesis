= Chaste: an open source C++ library for computational physiology and biology =

Welcome to the Chaste wiki.

This section contains pages generated automatically from the source code accompanying the paper "A flexible and extensible modelling framework for the simulation of vascular tumour growth: an extension to the Chaste open source C++ library for computational physiology and biology".

Before running these examples you will need to [wiki:InstallGuides/InstallGuide install Chaste's dependencies] and the [http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste/download.html source code for version 3.4].
The easiest way to do this is using an Ubuntu machine (or an Ubuntu virtual machine) as discussed on InstallGuides/UbuntuPackage.
Note that Chaste is only supported on Linux/Unix systems, so users of Windows or Mac OS X will need to follow the virtual machine route.
For manual installation of each dependency, on any version of Linux, see DeveloperInstallGuide.

This page links to a set of tutorials for using the software described in the paper, including the examples in the paper itself.
