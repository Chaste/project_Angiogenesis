= Angiogenesis Project =

The Angiogenesis project is a Chaste add-on with functionality for modelling blood vessels. It consists of a
C++ framework and a closely related Python framework.

Code details are included in this  "[./paper/chaste_angiogenesis.pdf paper]".

= Installation =
This project uses the new [wiki:ChasteGuides/CmakeBuildGuide CMake build system]. First [wiki:InstallGuides/InstallGuide install Chaste's dependencies] and the [http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste/download.html source code for version 3.4].
The easiest way to do this is using an Ubuntu machine (or an Ubuntu virtual machine) as discussed on InstallGuides/UbuntuPackage.
Note that Chaste is only supported on Linux/Unix systems, so users of Windows or Mac OS X will need to follow the virtual machine route.
For manual installation of each dependency, on any version of Linux, see DeveloperInstallGuide.

Then follow the [wiki:ChasteGuides/CmakeBuildGuide new CMake build system guide]. Two small changes are needed
to the file CMakeLists.txt in the Chaste source directory before building the Python interface. First an extra boos python library is needed: 

find_package(Boost COMPONENTS filesystem system serialization python REQUIRED)

In addition the project needs to be linked with a Python library, e.g.:

list(APPEND Chaste_LINK_LIBRARIES "path-to-lib/libpython2.7.so").

Check out the project source code following [wiki:InstallGuides/CheckoutUserProject.html] 

Set up the Python targets by doing make project_Angiogenesis. To actually build the shared libraries each
needs to be constructed using the make command and moved to the correct location in the module. A convenience
script is included in: 

From the build directory do:


== Usage ==
For the C++ framework source and test code are in the src and test folders respectively. Tests can be build using the CMake framework. Tutorials are listed on this page.

For the python framework the module is located in src/python and should be added to the PYTHONPATH. It
can then be used by doing: import chaste. Tutorials are included here:
