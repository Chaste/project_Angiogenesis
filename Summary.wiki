= Angiogenesis Project =

The Angiogenesis project is a Chaste add-on with functionality for modelling blood vessels. It is written in C++ and Python and is supported on Linux only.

= Installation =
The project can be used directly as a C++ library or else as a Python package.
First, Chaste dependencies need to be built from source following the [wiki:InstallGuides/InstallGuide Chaste Install Guide]. 
The project only supports the development version of Chaste. This can be obtained by doing:

{{{
svn --username anonymous checkout https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk/svn/chaste/trunk/ Chaste
}}}

using subversion. The project code itself can be obtained by doing: 

{{{
svn co "https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk/svn/chaste/projects/Angiogenesis"
}}}

The Angiogenesis project code needs to be included in the main Chaste source. This can be done with a symbolic link:

{{{
cd $CHASTE_SOURCE_DIR/projects
ln -s $ANGIOGENESIS_PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR
}}}

The C++ libraries can be built using either the standard Chaste Scons build system (see [wiki:ChasteGuides/DeveloperBuildGuide Chaste Developer Build Guide]) or the new [wiki:ChasteGuides/CmakeBuildGuide CMake build system] (preffered). 
For CMake, first create a build directory outside the source tree and proceed as:

{{{
cd $BUILD_DIR
cmake $CHASTE_SOURCE_DIR
make project_Angiogenesis
}}}

The will build the C++ library and all tests. To avoid building tests do:

{{{
make chaste_project_Angiogenesis
}}}

as the final command. Building the Python package requires Boost Python, which may already be installed on your system. If not, this can be done by adding `python` to the list of libraries to be built when following the Boost build instructions [wiki:InstallGuides/InstallGuide here].
Then do:

{{{
cmake -DBUILD_ANGIOGENESIS_PYTHON=ON $CHASTE_SOURCE_DIR
make project_Angiogenesis
make project_Angiogenesis_Python
}}}

The Python package `chaste` will be in `$BUILD_DIR` under `Chaste/projects/Angiogenesis/python` and can be imported in the typical way. For convenience, the directory `$BUILD_DIR/Chaste/projects/Angiogenesis/python` should be added to your PYTHONPATH and
the Chaste library directories to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

== Usage ==
For the C++ framework source and test code are in the `src` and `test` folders respectively. The Python source and tests are in the `src/python` and `test/python` folders. C++ unit tests can be built and run using the Chaste CMake framework [wiki:ChasteGuides/CmakeBuildGuide as detailed here]. It is recommended that the tutorials for 
either the [wiki:PaperTutorials/Angiogenesis/BuildVesselNetwork C++] or [wiki:PaperTutorials/Angiogenesis/PythonBuildVesselNetwork Python] frameworks are followed next. To run the first C++ tutorial do:

{{{
ctest -R TestBuildVesselNetworkLiteratePaper
}}}

To run all C++ tests do:

{{{
ctest -L project_Angiogenesis
}}}

To run the Python tutorial do:

{{{
python $BUILD_DIR/Chaste/projects/Angiogenesis/python/test/tutorial/TestPythonBuildVesselNetworkLiteratePaper.py
}}}

To run all Python tests do:

{{{
python $BUILD_DIR/Chaste/projects/Angiogenesis/python/test/run_tests.py
}}}
